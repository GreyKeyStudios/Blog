After a lot of late nights, trial and error, and nearly giving up at least three times… I officially completed the Cloud Resume Challenge.

The static resume is deployed.
The Azure Function works.
The visitor counter ticks.
CI/CD is up and running.

💡 Bonus: I decided not to stop at just a resume. I added a professional portfolio site button for serious visitors — and one more… let’s say “unexpected” button for the curious and chaotic. Just look for “THE BUTTON.” Click it at your own risk.

There’s still plenty to polish (and a follow-up post coming soon that breaks down the full process, setbacks, and how I overcame them), but for now — it’s live, it works, and it’s mine.

Stay tuned for updates.
And don’t forget to click the button 😉
