# Welcome to the Grey Key Blog

Welcome to the official blog of **Grey Key Studios** — a space where I document my creative and technical projects across cybersecurity, music production, AI development, and indie game design.

This blog exists as both a **living resume** and a **personal lab notebook**. Here, you'll find deep dives into what I'm working on, what I'm learning, what goes wrong (often), and how I solve it. Every post reflects real work that you can find in my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/yourusername), complete with code, configs, screenshots, and lessons learned.

## 🎯 What This Blog Covers

This blog will cover three major areas:

### 🔐 Cybersecurity Projects  
I'm currently studying for certifications and building projects to break into the field. These include:
- SOC dashboards (like the Splunk syslog monitoring lab)
- Threat detection labs
- Log parsing scripts
- Infrastructure as Code

### 🎵 Music & AI Experiments  
Music is therapy and expression. I document:
- Original songs (lyrics, production, video)
- Music education tools built with AI
- VST plugin development
- Vocal cloning and Synthesizer V workflows

### 🎮 Game & App Development  
I'm building creative tools and games like:
- A Blaxploitation-inspired fighting game (*Cooley's Revenge*)
- Interactive audio apps
- Browser-based learning tools for music & cyber concepts

## 🚧 Why I'm Doing This

Like many creators and career-changers, I've struggled to find the "right" way to showcase what I know. I'm not a traditional resume kind of person — I learn by doing. This blog lets me:
- **Document** my process
- **Show** my work
- **Improve** my skills
- **Share** what I learn

I'm not aiming to go viral. I'm aiming to get better, get noticed, and maybe help a few others on the way.

## 🧪 What's Coming Up

Here's a glimpse of upcoming blog posts:

- ✅ **Splunk Syslog Monitoring Lab** (SOC-style dashboard on Kali Linux)
- 🎛️ **Building an AI Music Plugin with JUCE + Web Tech**
- 👊🏾 **Designing Characters for a 70s-Style Fighting Game**
- 🔐 **Threat Detection with Python & Docker**

Each project will get its own dedicated post, with updates as I make progress.

Let's build.
